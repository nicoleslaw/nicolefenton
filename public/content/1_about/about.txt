## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I’m Nicole (they/them or she/her). I’m a principal writer, researcher, and design leader based in Virginia.

I believe that good design is clear, honest, and accessible. For over 15 years, I’ve led complex UX projects for clients in tech, publishing, education, finance, and government. Most recently, I oversaw design and research for state benefits programs at Nava.

As a generalist, I tend to follow my interests and people I respect. That strategy has shaped my career—from writing for Apple and Facebook, to researching across industries, teaching at [SVA](https://interactiondesign.sva.edu/), and managing remote teams at [Nava](https://www.navapbc.com/), [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), and [Vox Media](https://corp.voxmedia.com/).

In 2014, I cowrote *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](https://nicelysaid.co)*, which has been called practical, approachable, and timeless. (I hope to write another book someday.)
