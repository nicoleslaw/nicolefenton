We built the site with [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/). This project was a collaborative interagency effort with the [Plain Language Action and Information Network](https://plainlanguage.gov/about/) (PLAIN), [DigitalGov](https://www.digitalgov.gov/about/), and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).
