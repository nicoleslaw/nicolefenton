### [Words as Material](/words-as-material) ###
I’ve noticed a huge gap between writers and designers in the professional world, and I think it contributes to the larger communication problems we face.

### [Interface Writing: Code for Humans](/interface-writing/) ###
We build systems to help real people, but are we being that helpful in our interfaces? Or are we treating words as an afterthought and letting people fend for themselves?

### [Working With and Through Mental Illness](/working-with-and-through-mental-illness/) ###
More people miss work from stress and anxiety than physical illness or injury. In this post, I share a few things that help me cope with stress and trauma while serving others as best as I can.

### [Honest Marketing](/honest-marketing) ###
Most marketing sucks. But you’re making something you love and care about, and it’s not going to sell itself. In this talk, I share principles and activities for writing honestly.

### [Power and Responsibility](/power-and-responsibility/) ###
Have you ever looked someone up in a database? Did you find what you were looking for?

### [Writing for Beginners](/writing-for-beginners/) ###
