Project Lede:

Chroma was built to help you collect, tag, organize, and share things that interest you. The app’s founder and CEO hired me to tell that story as succinctly as possible.

<a href="http://chr.ma">Chroma</a> is a fun way to catalog curious things and share them with friends.

I had a blast working with [Andre Poremski](http://twitter.com/aporemski) and [Jonnie Hallman](http://destroytoday.com/) on this project. Andre needed help explaining what the product does and how it’s different from other photo apps on the market. I asked him why he decided to make Chroma, how he wanted people to use it, and what he wanted to accomplish. We talked through those communication goals and worked through some initial concepts together.

Jonnie and I collaborated on the marketing page and splash pages. We talked about different ways we could convey the product benefits, he laid out the visuals, and I wrote the tagline and marketing copy. I also came up with  specific use cases to help how you could use Chroma. Before the product launched, I wrote a brief product tour to bridge the gaps between the homepage and the new user experience.

Check out the Chroma site or [download the app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chroma-field-guide-for-anything/id879829383?mt=8) to give it a try.

> “Nicole helped me create a clean way of describing what you can do with Chroma. I use that as primary reference material for all outreach.”
