In 2014, I had the honor of copyediting two titles for A Book Apart: *[On Web Typography](//www.abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography)* by Jason Santa Maria and *[You’re My Favorite Client](//www.abookapart.com/products/youre-my-favorite-client)* by Mike Monteiro, my former boss at Mule Design. This year, I am continuing my work with A Book Apart as a developmental editor.
