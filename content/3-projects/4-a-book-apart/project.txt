This past summer, I had the honor of copyediting two titles for A Book Apart: [On Web Typography](//www.abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography) by Jason Santa Maria and [You’re My Favorite Client](//www.abookapart.com/products/youre-my-favorite-client) by Mike Monteiro, my former boss at Mule Design. A++ internet smarts all around.
