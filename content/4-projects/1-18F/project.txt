At the beginning of my two-year term, I developed the information architecture and content patterns for the [U.S. EITI](https://useiti.doi.gov/) website.

As the 18F onboarding lead, I helped launch the [18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/), developed a roadmap for new hire training, managed Slack-based classes, and contributed to our [open source checklist tool](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/21/checklistomania-makes-it-easy-to-keep-track-of-relative-tasks/).

I am a core contributor to the [18F Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/). In 2016, I edited and reorganized the guide so it’s easier to read, understand, and add to in the future.

18F has been a great place to hone my research skills. Along with internal design research, I conducted interviews and analysis to define [best practices in government digital transformation](https://github.com/18F/transformation-research). I’m currently working on user and content research for an [open data project with the FBI](https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer), and supporting the larger content design team as an experience design supervisor.
