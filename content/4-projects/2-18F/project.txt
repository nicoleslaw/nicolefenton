As an experience design supervisor at 18F, I manage a distributed team of content designers. My supervisory duties include scoping design projects, facilitating staffing decisions, coaching my team through difficult situations, developing hiring and performance criteria, recommending professional development opportunities, jumping through bureaucratic hoops, and promoting content strategy as a core design discipline.

Along with leading a team, I work on a billable projects. These have included:

* [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov)
* [Medicaid funding request app](https://github.com/18F/cms-hitech-apd)
* [FBI Crime Data Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/)
* [Best practices in government digital transformation](https://github.com/18F/transformation-research)
* [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
* [dotgov.gov](https://home.dotgov.gov)
* [worker.gov](https://github.com/18F/worker-dol-gov) (launching soon)
* [eRegulations](https://eregs.github.io/)
* [OMB Policy Library](https://omb-eregs-demo.app.cloud.gov/)
* [U.S. EITI](https://useiti.doi.gov/)

As part of these efforts, I have led interviews and usability sessions with policymakers, program managers, journalists, technical experts, and members of the public. I host content workshops with stakeholders—both in person and remotely—and have written all sorts of recommendations, [design principles](https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer/wiki/Experience-Principles), and research reports.

Shortly after becoming a supervisor, I led an unconference session about fostering resilience and mental health in the workplace. (I wrote [this personal essay](http://nicolefenton.com/working-with-and-through-mental-illness/) beforehand.)

I am also a core contributor to the [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/). In 2016, I edited and reorganized the guide so it’s easier to read, understand, and add to in the future.

As the 18F onboarding lead, I helped launch the [18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/), developed a roadmap for new hire training, managed Slack-based classes, and helped develop an [open source checklist tool](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/21/checklistomania-makes-it-easy-to-keep-track-of-relative-tasks/).
