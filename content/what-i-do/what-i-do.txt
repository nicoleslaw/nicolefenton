Process: 

### I listen and ask questions. ###

I care about people’s needs, feelings, and aspirations. I ask “Why?” and “What does this mean?” I aim for clarity, not cleverness.

### I collaborate and share what I know. ###

I believe in figuring things out together. I think out loud and on paper. I give honest feedback and workshop ideas with designers, developers, and product leads.

### I work in waves. ###

I start with the assumption that things will change. I sketch, draft, reflect, and revise. I write iteratively and teach others to do the same.

### I think about systems and focus on details. ###

I balance business goals with user needs. I put people over politics, connect different teams, and make the creative process work for you.

### I design with words. ###

I plan, write, edit, and design interfaces. I develop forms and flows and organize complicated bits of information. I put your readers first and decoration last.
