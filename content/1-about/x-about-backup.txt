## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I’m a senior product writer and researcher based in central Virginia. I work on critical government services for the public at [Nava](https://www.navapbc.com/).

I believe that good content is clear, conversational, and inclusive. You can learn more about my approach to developing user-centered products in the archives here and in my book, *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](https://nicelysaid.co)*.

For over 15 years, I’ve worked to make the web more friendly, accessible, and honest. Before joining Nava, I was the communications and training manager for Chorus at Vox Media, head of content design at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a graduate instructor and thesis advisor at the School of Visual Arts, a senior content strategist at Facebook, and a communications lead at Apple. As an independent editor and user experience consultant, I’ve worked with all kinds of clients including A Book Apart, Happy Cog, Lab Zero, Macmillan Publishers, Pinterest, and ProPublica.
