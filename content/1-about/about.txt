## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I manage communications and training for [Chorus](https://getchorus.voxmedia.com/) at Vox Media. I’m also the coauthor of *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20)* with Kate Kiefer Lee.

Before this, I was head of content design at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a senior content strategist at Facebook, and an independent editor and user experience consultant. I developed a strategic writing course for interaction designers at the School of Visual Arts. I’m also a core contributor to the [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/). Over the years, I’ve worked with all sorts of clients including A Book Apart, Happy Cog, Macmillan Publishers, Microsoft, Pinterest, ProPublica, Safari Books Online, and the FBI. I started my professional writing practice at Apple, where I served as communications lead for five years.

I live in Virginia with [my partner](https://maxfenton.com/), our daughter, and a dog named TK.
