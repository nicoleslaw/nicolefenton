Text: ## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I believe good writing is clear, honest, and friendly. I wrote a book about that with Kate Kiefer Lee called *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20)*. You can [read an excerpt](//ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321988195/samplepages/0321988191.pdf) of it or [buy a copy](//nicelysaid.co) at your favorite bookstore.

I’m currently editing for [A Book Apart](//abookapart.com), writing personal essays, and preparing to teach a writing course in the spring. I’m booked up right now, but always happy to hear from you by email.

For the curious, I used to be a senior content strategist at [Facebook](//facebook.com), [Lab Zero](//labzero.com), and [Mule Design](//muledesign.com) in San Francisco. I started my professional writing practice at [Apple](//apple.com), where I served as communications lead for five years and helped launch the original iPhone and iPad. I have an English degree from the University of Texas and an eternal hankering for tacos.

I live in Brooklyn with my [husband](//maxfenton.com) and our [little chihuahua](//instagram.com/explore/tags/geoffreyjonesfenton/).
