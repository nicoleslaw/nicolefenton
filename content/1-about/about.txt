Text: ## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I believe good writing is clear, honest, and friendly. I recently cowrote a book about that called *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20)* with Kate Kiefer Lee. You can [read an excerpt](//ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321988195/samplepages/0321988191.pdf) of it or [buy a copy](//nicelysaid.co) at your favorite bookstore.

I’m currently helping two clients with their publishing workflows; working with [Happy Cog](//happycog.com); advising graduate students; and teaching workshops on a limited basis. If you’re interested in working with me, I expect to have some availability in the early summer. Until then, I’m always happy to hear from you by email.

For the curious, I used to be a senior content strategist at [Facebook](//facebook.com), [Lab Zero](//labzero.com), and [Mule Design](//muledesign.com) in San Francisco. I started my professional writing practice at [Apple](//apple.com), where I served as communications lead for five years and helped launch the original iPhone and iPad. I have an English degree from the University of Texas at Austin and an eternal hankering for tacos.

In the evenings, I read a lot and run [Born Hungry](//bornhungrymag.com), an online magazine for home cooks. I live in Brooklyn with my [husband](http://maxfenton.com) and our little chihuahua, and work from [Studiomates](//studiomates.com).
