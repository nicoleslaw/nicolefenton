## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I am an innovation specialist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a digital design and technology agency within the U.S. government. I also edit books for [A Book Apart](//abookapart.com) and teach at the [School of Visual Arts](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/).

I am the coauthor of *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20)* with Kate Kiefer Lee. You can [read an excerpt](//ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321988195/samplepages/0321988191.pdf) of it or [buy a copy](//nicelysaid.co) at your favorite bookstore.

I spent the last few years consulting, teaching workshops, and speaking at conferences internationally. Previously, I was a senior content strategist at [Facebook](//facebook.com), [Lab Zero](//labzero.com), and [Mule Design](//muledesign.com) in San Francisco. I started my professional writing practice at [Apple](//apple.com), where I served as communications lead for five years and helped launch the original iPhone and iPad.

I live in Brooklyn with my [husband](//maxfenton.com), our daughter, and our [little chihuahua](//instagram.com/explore/tags/geoffreyjonesfenton/).
