## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I am an innovation specialist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a digital design and technology consultancy within the U.S. government. I also teach in the MFA Interaction Design program at the [School of Visual Arts](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/).

I am the coauthor of *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20)* with Kate Kiefer Lee. You can [read an excerpt](//ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321988195/samplepages/0321988191.pdf) of it or [buy a copy](//nicelysaid.co) at your favorite bookstore.

Before joining 18F, I was an independent user-experience consultant, working directly with clients on web and editorial projects of all sizes. Previously, I was a senior content strategist at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Lab Zero](http://labzero.com/), and [Mule Design](http://muledesign.com/). I started my professional writing practice at [Apple](//apple.com), where I served as communications lead for five years.

I live in Brooklyn with my [husband](https://maxfenton.com/), our daughter, and our [little chihuahua](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/geoffreyjonesfenton/).
