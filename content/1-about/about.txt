## Hello ## {.list-section-title}

I am the content design manager at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a digital design and technology consultancy within the federal government. I recently directed the redesign of [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov), and I’m a core contributor to the [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/).

I am the coauthor of *[Nicely Said: Writing for the Web with Style and Purpose](//www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321988191?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321988191&linkCode=xm2&tag=nicelysaid-20)* with Kate Kiefer Lee. You can [read an excerpt](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321988195/samplepages/0321988191.pdf) of it or [buy a copy](http://nicelysaid.co) at your favorite bookstore.

Before joining 18F, I was an independent editor and user experience consultant, working directly with clients on web and editorial projects of all sizes. I also taught a strategic writing course for interaction designers at the [School of Visual Arts](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/). Before that, I was a senior content strategist at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Lab Zero](http://labzero.com/), and [Mule Design](http://muledesign.com/). I started my professional writing practice at [Apple](http://apple.com), where I served as communications lead for five years.

I live in Virginia with [my husband](https://maxfenton.com/), our daughter, and our dog.
